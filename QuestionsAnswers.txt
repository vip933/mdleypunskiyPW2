\f1\b Question: 
\f0\b0 What will happen if we remove \'93addSubview\'94 line? What about the line with \'93= false\'94? \
Answer: if we remove this live we won\'92t see our element, because it won\'92t be added on the screen. settingsButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false makes compiler not to determinate constraints automatically, so we can add them by ourself.\
